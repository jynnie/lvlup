# lvlup

lvlup (pronounced "level up") is a custom mark-_up_ language structured around _levels_ of details. the name (and file extension `.lvl`) are still tentatively named such.

lvlup blends Markdown and ReST syntax for a human readable, lightweight markup language with more structure.

included in this are _examples_ of notes/files written in lvlup and src for a site that parses lvlup into html.
